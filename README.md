# JPACRUDProject

## Overview
An application that allows a user to search a database of the different religions. The application supports full CRUD operations to allow a user to add their own religion and view the beliefs of existsing religions, the number of followers, the religion's founder, date the religion was established, place of origin and if the religion worships any idols.  

## How to Run
To run this application, the user starts at the homepage and has 2 options to select from: either look up a religions details by entering it's respective ID or add a new religion to the database. If the user chooses to search for a religion and finds a match, they are presented with the religions details with the option to delete or update the religion.


## Technologies Used
* SpringToolSuite4
* MySQL
* Gradle 
* Java
* DAOs & DAOImpls
* HTML
* JBDC
* J-Unit Tests
* JSPs
* CRUD Concepts

## Lessons Learned
The biggest lesson learned involves Spring and where certain keywords need to match for the controller and JSP to function correctly. As well as the implementation of MySql data and how it is translated/expressed through Spring tools. My use and understanding of the Request Param and Request Mapping fields increased while working on this project; providing me a big-picture insight as to its' uses and purpose.
